- v1.0.5 Jan 2023
	- catch all exceptions in paramiko in ssh.connect and ssh.exec_command and print to logger
	
- v1.0.4 Sep 2022
	- catch paramiko.ssh_exception.NoValidConnectionsError and print exception to avoid printing error stack
	  This happens when there is no sshd on port 22 on target
	
- v1.0.3 Aug 2022
	- In addition to catching ssh connection exceptions and printing exception name, also 
	  return string f"AuthenticationException: {e}" to let calling function handle it.
	  Not reraising exception though, to be in line with what happens when error happens while running remote script
	
- v1.0.2 Feb 2022
	- Catch paramiko ssh connection exceptions to print just exception name instead of full stack.
	  This in particular covers wrong hostname and wrong ssh password.
	
- v1.0.1 Dec 2021
	- added "cd /tmp" before sending script to pbrun, to avoid 
		```
		shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Permission denied
		chdir: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Permission denied
		```
		from pbrun attempting to run script in connected user directory
		
- v1.0
	- initial version
